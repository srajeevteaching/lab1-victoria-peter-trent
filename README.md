Lab 1


Problem
Write a program that asks the user for a number of milliliters (mL) and outputs the equivalent number of teaspoons and tablespoons. Note: Assume there are (rounding up) 5mL in a teaspoon and 3 teaspoons in a tablespoon.

Instructions
Create test cases (see section below).
Create a new Python file and include intro comments at the top of your .py file (template below).
Use comments to write the algorithm your program will follow.
Write the Python code corresponding to each of your algorithm's steps.
Test your completed code using your test cases. If the output doesn't match, correct your program.
Commit and push changes and check github.com to confirm the update before leaving lab (even if not finished).

Test Cases
Create an Excel File with at least five test cases. Use one row per test case with columns for description, input, output 1, and output 2. Use a calculator if needed to compute the outputs. The following provides the first test and hints for the remaining four.

Simple non-zero situation: Input: 1ml, Output Teaspoons: 0.2, Output Tablespoons: 0.066667
Zero as input
Case giving exactly 1 teaspoon as result
Case giving exactly 1 tablespoon as result
Large number of teaspoons and tablespoons
Submission
